# CargoSync Space Station Cargo Management System

## Project Overview
CargoSync is a comprehensive cargo management system designed to optimize storage, retrieval, and disposal of items aboard space stations. The system addresses the critical challenge of managing cargo efficiently in space environments, where storage operations can consume up to 25% of astronauts' time.

## Features

### 1. Efficient Cargo Placement
- Automatically suggests optimal placement for new items based on available space, priority, and accessibility
- Considers item dimensions, priority levels, and preferred zones
- Provides visualization of cargo placement within containers

### 2. Quick Item Retrieval
- Locates items with minimal steps required for retrieval
- Considers item priority and expiration dates
- Provides step-by-step retrieval instructions

### 3. Space Optimization
- Recommends rearrangement of items to maximize storage efficiency
- Prioritizes high-value items for easier access
- Minimizes movement of items during rearrangements

### 4. Waste Management
- Automatically identifies expired or fully used items
- Categorizes waste items by type
- Suggests disposal containers and procedures
- Tracks waste statistics and space reclamation

### 5. Cargo Return Planning
- Manages the return of waste items to Earth
- Generates manifests for undocking modules
- Optimizes cargo return within weight constraints

### 6. Time Simulation
- Simulates passage of time to plan for future scenarios
- Tracks item usage and expiration
- Provides forecasting for space management

### 7. Comprehensive Logging
- Tracks all cargo movements and operations
- Records user actions, timestamps, and locations
- Generates reports and analytics for mission planning

## System Architecture

The system is built with a modern tech stack:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: [Your backend technology]
- **Database**: [Your database technology]
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- [Any other prerequisites]

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [repository URL]
   cd [repository directory]
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t cargosync .
   ```

3. Run the container:
   ```
   docker run -p 8000:8000 --network=host cargosync
   ```

4. Access the application at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```
## Usage Instructions

### Item Placement
1. Import containers using the Containers Import form
2. Import items using the Items Import form
3. Navigate to the Arrangements page to view placement recommendations

### Item Retrieval
1. Use the search function to locate an item
2. Follow the step-by-step retrieval instructions
3. Mark the item as retrieved when complete

### Waste Management
1. Navigate to the Waste Management page
2. View categorized waste items
3. Plan for waste disposal using the return planning feature

### Time Simulation
1. Use the simulation controls to advance time
2. Review changes to item status and space availability
